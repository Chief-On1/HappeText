    <p>
        At <strong>HappeText</strong>, your privacy is important to us. We are committed to ensuring that any information you share with us is kept secure and used only to provide you with a seamless and enjoyable experience.  
        <em><strong>While weâ€™re here to bring a little holiday magic to your messages, we want to clarify that HappeText is not Santa Claus himself or nothing with Santa Claus!

    <b>Information We Collect</b>
    <p>
        We only collect the information necessary to generate your personalized Christmas messages. This includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Sender's name</b> (to personalize the greeting).</li>
        <li><b>Recipient's name</b> (to make the message more meaningful).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We do not collect, store, or use any other personal information.
    </p>
    <b>How We Use Your Information</b>
    <p>
        The information you provide is used solely to create and display your personalized Christmas greeting. 
        Once your greeting is generated, all data is immediately discarded. 
        We do not store or retain any details about you or your recipients.
    </p>
    <b>Data Security</b>
    <p>
        We take every precaution to ensure your data is secure while it is being used to generate your greeting. 
        Since we do not store any personal data on our servers, there is no risk of it being exposed or misused after your interaction is complete.
    </p>
    <b>Your Rights</b>
    <p>
        You have complete control over the information you provide. You can choose not to provide certain details, 
        but this may limit the functionality of the service, such as generating personalized greetings. 
        Rest assured, your data will never be shared, sold, or used for any purpose beyond creating your message.
    </p>
    <b>Changes to This Privacy Policy</b>
    <p>
        We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect improvements or changes in our practices.
